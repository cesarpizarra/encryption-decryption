# Simple Encryption and Decryption

The Simple Encryption and Decryption application is a web-based tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple encryption algorithm.

## How it works

1. Enter the message you want to encrypt into the input field.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message using the encryption algorithm.
3. The encrypted message will be displayed in the output field.
4. To decrypt the message, copy the encrypted message and paste it into the input field.
5. Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the message using the decryption algorithm.
6. The original message will be displayed in the output field.

## Encryption Algorithm

The encryption algorithm used in this application is a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the message is replaced with another letter or symbol based on a predetermined rule.

## Decryption Algorithm

The decryption algorithm is the reverse of the encryption algorithm. It takes the encrypted message and applies the inverse substitution rule to retrieve the original message.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the input field to enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Click the corresponding button ("Encrypt" or "Decrypt") to perform the desired operation.
5. The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed in the output field.
